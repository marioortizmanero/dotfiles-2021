== Native

=== Movement

* `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for *movement* (left, down, up, right).
* `w`, `e` to move to the beginning or end of the *next word*. `b` to move to
  the beginning of the *previous word*. Uppercased, special characters like
  commas will be skipped (not spaces). `W` and `E` will do the same with *WORDS*
  (skips special characters)
* `a` enters insert mode after the cursor. `A` to insert into the end of a line,
  `I` to insert it at the beginning of the line.
* `{` or `}` to go to the start or end of a *block*.
* `%` jumps from a *parenthesis*/similar to the the other (`)`,`]`,`}`).
* `]c` jumps to the next *git-gutter change*, and `[c` to the previous one.
* `gn` jumps to the next *Coc-Nvim diagnostic*, and `gN` to the previous one.
* `gd` jumps to the *function/type definition*, and `gr` jumps to the first
  reference.
* `Ctrl+o` jumps to the last position.

NOTE: You can type a number before most of these commands to *repeat* them. `2j`
goes to the letter 2 positions to the left. It can be done with text too if you
type `i+<esc>` after writing the text desired.

=== Selecting and editing

* `u` *undos* the last changes.
* `Ctrl+r` *redos* the last undo.
* `V` selects an entire line, `v` starts a *selection*. `Ctrl+v` selects blocks
  instead. `o` moves the cursor to the other end of the selection.  To insert
  text, select, press `Shift+i` and insert it.
* `y` to *copy* the selection, `d` to *cut* it, `p` to *paste* after the cursor.
  `P` pastes before. `x` cuts a single character. `r` to replace a single
  character. `c` will delete the character (or word with `ce`) and enter insert
  mode.
* `d` or `y` followed by `aw` will do the action the current word. `D` will
  delete from the cursor to the end of line.
* `>` or `<` after selecting a block will increase or decrease its indentation
  by 1. This can be done repeatedly if a number is input before, like `5>`
* `o` opens a line below and enters insert mode. `O` does the same but above the
  current line.
* `=` will *fix the indentation* for a selection.
* `gq` will *line-wrap* a selection for the `textwidth` set.

=== Searching

* `/` followed by a word will find its following *occurences* in the file and
  `?` the previous. `n` goes to the next result and `N` to the previous one.
* `:%s/foo/bar/g` will *replace* all `foo` occurrences for `bar`. Flags: `c` to
  confirm, `g` for global results (not only the first is changed), `i` for case
  insensitive and the `%` at the beginning is to replace in the entire file
  instead of the current line.

=== Splits and Tabs

.Opening new tabs or splits
* `:vs <file>` to split vertically and `:sp <file>` to split horizontally a new
  file.
* `:tabedit` to open a new tab with a file.

.Moving between splits, first pressing `Ctrl+w` and then:
* `w` *cycles* between tabs. Spamming `Ctrl+w` also works.
* `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to *move* to the left, down, up or right tab.
* `H`, `J`, `K`, `L` to move the tab to the left, down, up or right side
* `c` to *close* a tab.
* `T` to move it to a *new* full-window tab. `:tab sp` to copy it instead.
* `:res <lines>` to resize a tab. If on a terminal, `Ctrl+W` opens the vim
  commands.

.Moving between tabs
* `gt` to go to next tab, `gT` to the previous one, and `{i}gt` to the `i`th.
  `Ctrl+PgUp` and `Ctrl+PgDown` are the same, respectively.

=== Folding

* `zo` to *open* the fold, `zc` to *close* it. `za` to *toggle* the fold, `zA`
  to do it recursively.
* `zR` to *open all* folds, `zM` to *close all* folds.

=== Spelling

* `:set spell spelllang=LANG` will enable the spellchecking, where `LANG` can be
  any code like `en_us` or `es`.
* `]s` and `[s` to go to the next/previous bad word.
* `zg` to add a word to the current spelling dictionary, and `zw` to mark it as
  a bad word. Use `zug` and `zuw` to undo these actions.

=== Macros

* `qa` starts *recording macro*, `q` stops recording.
* `@a` will play the macro, `@:` will play the last macro.

== Custom and Plugins

=== LSP

* `K` to hover and *see documentation*.
* `,e` to show *diagnostics* for that line.
* `gD` to jump to the *declaration*.
* `gd` to jump to the *definition*.
* `gi` to jump to the *implementation*.
* `gr` to *list the references*.
* `,r` to *rename*.
* `Tab` for the *autocompletion* dialog, `Shift+Tab` for inverse movement.
* `]e` to move to the *next diagnostic*, `[e` to the previous one.

=== NERDTree, Fuzzy Finder

.NerdTREE
* `:NERDTree` to open the file manager to the left.
* _`?` for more bindings inside it._

.Fuzzy Finder
* `,ff` to find *files*.
* `,fl` to find *lines* in the entire *path*.
* `,fL` to find *lines* in the current *buffer*.

Opening files in both is the same, but Fuzzy Finder requires `Ctrl` as well for
the last ones:

* `Return` *opens* the file.
* `i` opens the file in *splitscreen*.
* `s` opens the file in *vertical* splitscreen.
* `t` opens the file in a new **tab**.

=== Custom bindings

* `,+` opens a new *terminal* at the fileâ€™s directory (shortcut for
  `:TermFromCurDir`.
* `,t` opens a *vim terminal* at the bottom (shortcut for `:VimTerm`).
* `,c` *toggles a comment* for the selection or current line with NERDCommenter.

.Toggle configuration
* `,i` for *indentation*: spaces (default) and tabs.
* `,l` for the *column length hint*: 80 (default) and 120.
* `,n` for the *column numbers*: on (default) and off.
* `,N` for *column numbers mode*: relative (default) and absolute.

=== Custom commands

* `:QuickHelp` opens this help file.
* `:CopyDir` copies the current file directory to the clipboard.
* `:NoteTakingMode` and `:InsertX` are useful to take notes quickly.

.Live preview
* `:MarkdownPreview`: Markdown.
* `:VimtexCompile`: LaTeX. 
* `:AdocPdfLiveOpen`: Asciidoctor for PDF.
